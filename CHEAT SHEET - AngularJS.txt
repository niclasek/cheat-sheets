CHEAT-SHEET - ANGULARJS

Directives:
At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) 
to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.
<html ng-app> - The ng-app attribute represents an AngularJS directive, named ngApp
(AngularJS uses kebab-case for its custom attributes and camelCase for the corresponding directives which implement them)

ngRepeat - a directive that repeats the tag for each object in a list. For example: <li ng-repeat="phone in phones">

ngController - a directive that attaches a controller to a tag. For example: <body ng-controller="PhoneListController">
At this point:
- PhoneListController is in charge of the DOM sub-tree under (and including) the <body> element.
- In the DOM we can access the objects (models) in the controller. 


$scope vs $rootScope
Scopes allows for the template, model and controller to work together
Root scope is the scope of the app
Scope is the scope in a controller
